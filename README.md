## 📌 Project Goals

- Maintain a clean and reproducible Python3 project environment.
- Ensure all required tools are installed before development.
- Provide automated setup scripts.
- Utilize a virtual machine to simulate real-world deployment/testing.
- Enforce clean code practices via GitHub features (PRs, protected branches).
